Hello! This is simple bug tracking system. Feel free to check it live on https://serene-crag-19372.herokuapp.com/  
Just give it time to wake up. 

And quick update. Right now if you delete project or user, all assosiated tasks would be deleted.   
It's not that hard to give user a veiw where he can rearrange users or projects for all that tasks. 
In my opinion, it's nesessary only if you delete user, just becouse if there is no project, there is no tasks. 
And ofcorse we need to give possibility to change executor when you delete one.  
Anyway, this feature for now is only "to be implemented". THX
